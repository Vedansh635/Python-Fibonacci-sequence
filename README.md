# Project-Description

Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a given number `n` with this Python function! This implementation uses a while loop to efficiently produce the sequence, starting from 0 and 1. Simply input the desired `n` value and get the list of Fibonacci numbers up to that point.

# Features:

- Efficient while loop implementation<br>
- User input for customizable sequence generation<br>
- Returns a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the given n value<br>
- Example usage: Run the script, input a number, and get the Fibonacci sequence up to that number!<br>

# Example usage: 
- Run the script, input a number, and get the Fibonacci sequence up to that number!
